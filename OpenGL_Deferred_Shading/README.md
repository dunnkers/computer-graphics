# Deferred Shading
> An additional assignment in the CG 2018-2019 programme

`[14-06-2019]`

## Usage

Program was tested on the RUG LWP Ubuntu computers.

## General
	
I began with the CG 18-19 OpenGL_3 startpoint code from Nestor and starting building on top of that. I first implemented some abstractions for easily rendering multiple meshes and textures, see the `Mesh` and `Object` classes. An object is an entity that is rendered on screen, which can have a texture and a mesh attached. A mesh is loaded using the `Model` class. Next, I also added a view transform in order to simulate a camera view. All rotational controls rotate the entire scene. 

## gBuffers

Upon intialization of the main view we first create a framebuffer object and then create all gBuffers required, storing them in a texture. We create gBuffers to store color, normals, position and depth. All this is done in the `FramebufferObjectInstance` class.

Instead of just using a `RGBA` type format for the textures, I decided to use a `RGA8` internalFormat for my color texture, and a `GL_RGBA16F` for my normals and position texture. For the depth texture we are (obviously) using a `GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT` format.

I created a little control panel in the UI for selecting a gBuffer to be rendered.

In this way, we can visualize all gBuffers.

Color texture:

Normals texture:

Position texture:

Depth texture:

We send all gBuffer textures by hooking a uniform for every texture. We allocate a separate texture location for every gBuffer, ranging from `GL_TEXTURE0` to `GL_TEXTURE3`. Upload performed in `FramebufferObjectInstance::updateShaderUniforms`.

â†’ Also, upon resizing, all gBuffer textures are correctly re-initialized using `glTexImage2D`.

## (Deferred) Rendering / Shading

### First pass
We first cycle through the rendering once, simply rendering the geometry without any lighting calculations. We bind the fbo before rendering thus rendering into our (non-default) fbo. I created a simple shader for simply rendering objects: `vertshader_geometry` and `fragshader_geometry`. We render all objects in this pass (in this case, a lot of cats).

We switch back to the normal fbo by binding `defaultFramebufferObject()`: 

`glBindFramebuffer(GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER, defaultFramebufferObject);`

### Second pass
Lighting pass. I am using one shader which computes a directional (sun) light and light bulbs. The shader is called `vertshader_light.glsl` and `fragshader_light.glsl`.

We supply the light shader with 3 vertices without attributes and use this to render a quad. The vertex shader supplies the fragment coordinates to the fragment shader. In the fragment shader, we can then grab the data from the gBuffers, which have been filled in the first pass.

In order to now compute the lighting, we do then still need to compute, for every fragment, its original world location. We do this by supplying the inverse view-project matrix as a uniform to the shader

***Sunlight (directional):***

***Lightbulbs (point lights):***
I added lots of different point light sources to best illustrate the benefit of deferred shading. A grid of light points are generated, hovering slightly above the cats. The colors are generated at random in the `lightpoint.cpp` class.

Using both light sources:

Both shaders can be turned on or off individually using the UI.

### Scene

I drew a scene with a grid of cats on top of a large box, with some planets around it. Light sources hover above the cats.

![scene-4](./Screenshots/scene-4.png)

Grid size if configurable in the `createObjects()` function in `mainview.cpp` by editing variables `w` and `h`.

### Animation

By pressing the animate checkbox the lightbulbs will hover up and down. This way, you can see the light interactions better as well test the performance.

### Performance

Pressing the `run performance test` button will rotate the screen and measure average FPS. Test will last 30 seconds or can be stopped earlier by pressing the button.

When test is stopped the average fps is printed onto the console.

### Controls

You can use the mousewheel to scale (zoom in and out).
